  <div class="post_body"><p>Here is a quick update on fish development and the plans for a new release.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the fish committers agreed to undertake a significant rework
of the fish source code. In particular, efforts are underway to change the C++
core of fish to Rust. There are several reasons for this rewrite, including that
it enables development of a concurrent execution mode to allow background
execution of fish functions and related benefits. There’s an <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9512">extended
discussion on GitHub</a>, if
you’re interested.</p>

<p>However, this is a process that is likely to take six months or more. In that
time the source tree will probably not be suitable for general release. The
performance of the partially-rewritten program is worse and building it is more
complicated. <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/wiki/Development-builds">Development
builds</a> are
currently not being generated because they’re frankly more trouble than they’re
worth.</p>

<p>The process is going reasonably well, with about 20% of the C++ code
removed in the last few months (as I measure it anyway). However, my
estimate is that it will not be ready for beta testing until late 2023
at the earliest.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues?q=milestone%3A%22fish+3.6.2%22">handful of fixes for fish
3.6.1</a> that I think are worth rolling
up and <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/discussions/9684">making a 3.6.2
release</a> for, though I don’t have a specific
timeline for doing so.</p>

<p>Hope that helps keep you informed!</p>
